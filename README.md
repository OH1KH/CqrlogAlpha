# CqrlogAlpha
CqrlogAlpha is a clone from Cqrlog by OK2CQR & OK1RR.

If you can not find what you are looking for from here you are propably looking source of CqrlogAlpha
that still exist in my old repository.

Until this get fixed you find develop version source (that is ahead of this repository's stable compiled version) from:

(source): https://github.com/OH1KH/cqrlog/tree/loc_testing

See you there, 73!
