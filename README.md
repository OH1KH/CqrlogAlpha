# CqrlogAlpha
CqrlogAlpha is a Cqrlog (by OK2CQR&amp;OK1RR) clone that is under development.

If you found yourself from here you are probaly looking source or ready compiled versions of CqrlogAlpha
that still exist in my old repository.

Until this get fixed you find current versions you are looking for from:

(source): https://github.com/OH1KH/cqrlog/tree/loc_testing

(ready compiled): https://github.com/OH1KH/cqrlog/tree/loc_testing/compiled
